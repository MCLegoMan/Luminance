## Mod Developers:  
- "Entity Linked" Shaders under the "perspective" and/or "souper_secret_settings" namespaces should have a mod priority of:  
  1. "souper_secret_settings"  
  2. "perspective"  
  3. any other mods.  
  - This means, your mod should check if souper_secret_settings or perspective is installed before rendering.  
    - Perspective will check if soup is installed, and if so will let soup render the shader.
