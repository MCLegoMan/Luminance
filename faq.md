- **Are older versions of Perspective/Souper Secret Settings supported?**  
  - They should work with Luminance, however Luminance specific features won't.  
  - Luminance will disable Shader Namespace and Shader Texture Namespace Fixes if `Perspective <=1.3.0-alpha.6` or `Souper Secret Settings <=1.0.8` are detected as these versions fix these already.  
    - Luminance will also disable the Shader Namespace Fix if any version of `architectury` or `satin` are installed as those mods also fix it.
