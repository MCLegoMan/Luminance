## About
Luminance is a library mod that is primarily designed to help other mods with shaders.

# Features  
- **Adds Dynamic Shader Uniforms**
  - These let post-processing shaders have more information about what's happening in-game.
  - Luminance comes with a bunch of these by default, but you can add your own too!
- **Adds shaders that have been used in previous minecraft versions.**
  - _Requires [Perspective](https://modrinth.com/mod/mclegoman-perspective) or [Souper Secret Settings](https://modrinth.com/mod/souper-secret-settings)._
- **Fixes Shader Namespace Bugs.**  
  - Minecraft doesn't use namespaces for shaders and shader textures, Luminance fixes that.  
- **Compatibility**  
  - Luminance takes care of rendering shaders, so you don't have to!  
  - You can check if Iris Shaders are enabled using Luminance.  
    - This means you don't have to have Iris added to your development environment!  
  - You can replace your ModMenu icon using Luminance!  
    - Make your mod icon change depending on the time of year, or via a config option, anything's possible!
